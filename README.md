# Reading list Differential Geometry
Here is a list of courses/books one can use. This list is presented in no particular order of reading, but in a order I feel easier to understand. 
To begin with <br />
* The most important book is [Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces by Manfredo doCarmo](http://www.math.uni.lodz.pl/~maczar/ggk/do%20Carmo,%20Differential%20Geometry%20of%20Curves%20and%20Surfaces.pdf).<br />
* Associated lecture by [Claudio Arezzo at ICTP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKnBj7B2PSg&list=PLLq_gUfXAnkl5JArcktbOrIUeR5rra-Gz). The lectures go through the chapters of the book and make the reading so much easier.
