# Reading list Differential Geometry
Here is a list of courses/books one can use. This list is presented in no particular order of reading, but in a order I feel easier to understand. 
To begin with <br />
* The most important book is [Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces by Manfredo doCarmo](http://www.math.uni.lodz.pl/~maczar/ggk/do%20Carmo,%20Differential%20Geometry%20of%20Curves%20and%20Surfaces.pdf).<br />
* Associated lecture by [Claudio Arezzo at ICTP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKnBj7B2PSg&list=PLLq_gUfXAnkl5JArcktbOrIUeR5rra-Gz). The lectures go through the chapters of the book and make the reading so much easier. <br />

**Other reference books:**
* Numerical Geometry of Rigid Shapes by Alex Bronstein, Michael Bronstein and Ron Kimmel.
* Differential Geometry: Curves, Surfaces and Manifold by Wolfgang Kuhnel. 
* A panaromic view of Riemannian Geometry by Marcel Berger. [link](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540653172)
* Calculus on Manifolds by Michael Spivak.
* Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity by Sean Carroll.

In my opinion, someone interested in geometry should also have a keen interest in physics with emphasis on classical mechanics, Einstein's relativity. It makes the reading much easier as it helps one to visualize the concepts. In that spirit some of the popular science books in no particular order are: <br />
* **The Road to Reality by Roger Penrose:** [link](https://www.amazon.com/Road-Reality-Complete-Universe-Paperback/dp/B010WEZEDG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1516390192&sr=8-3&keywords=the+road+to+reality) This is an amazing book if you have the time to go through it. It is huge over a 1000 pages. The reason it is such an important book is because it takes you on a chronological journey of mathematics. Understanding the limitations of available mathematical tools will help one to appreciate the efforts made in discovering new tools. 
* **Special Relativity and Classical Field Theory: The Theoretical Minimum:** [link](https://www.amazon.com/Special-Relativity-Classical-Field-Theory/dp/0465093345/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1516390740&sr=1-3&keywords=leonard+susskind) This is a book which I still have to read but it follows the lectures of Prof. Leonard Susskind and the amazing website [The Theoretical Minimum](http://theoreticalminimum.com/)
* **Topology and Geometry:** An amazing lecture series by Prof. Tadashi Tokieda on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXHHvoaSctc&list=PLTBqohhFNBE_09L0i-lf3fYXF5woAbrzJ)
* **3Blue1Brown:** An amazing YouTube channel discussing Topology and visualizations. [Here is the link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)
* **Mathematical Methods and its Applications:** If you get stuck on some small mathematical notion which we always do at times. Here is a lecture series which can help [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q2BsWzjVvM&list=PLq-Gm0yRYwTizdeCch3lvaq-DWTh1Nfo2)
